# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
PyBer is a python-based ride share app company.   The company has an ultimate goal of improving access and affordability to underserviced communities.  PyBer has asked the team to look closer at the data collected from January 2019 to May 2019.  The team needs to provide insight into the relationship between drivers, riders, fare costs and city type.

## Results: 

I used Jupyter Notebook for the python script and the following dependencies: Matplotlib and pandas.  Two cvs files were provided for the analysis: “city_data.cvs” and “ride_data.cvs”.  Both cvs files are located in the “Resources” folder.  

### Deliverable 1: A Summary DataFrame 

To create a summary dataframe from the cvs file, we had to combine the two cvs files. This was done through python by merging on city.  After merging the files into a single dataframe, we could start aggregating the data into a summary dataframe.  The .sum() and .count() methods were used to obtain the PyBer Summary dataframe found below. 





## Summary: 

Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
